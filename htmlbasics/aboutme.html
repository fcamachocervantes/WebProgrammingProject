    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello I'm Paco, I'm a Senior in CS doing a focus on Cyber Security.
        My parents are both from Guanajuanto Mexico 
        from two small towns. My mom is from San Pablo. I have three older siblings, My sister Ana, and
        my two brothers Pepe and David. We were all born in Denver, Colorado
        but spent our summers and sometimes winter breaks with family back in 
        San Pablo living on el rancho as my family would say.
        I'm an uncle to my niece Briza and two nephews, Dominic and Leo. I have
        a dog Mocho who I've had since I was 7 who will be turning 14 this year.
    </p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        In my free time I enjoy to go moutain biking, play videogames, lift weights and spend time with my dog.
        This is my 3rd year being in the Mines Esports Club playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive which will hopefully finally release
        a big update soon and become CS2.
