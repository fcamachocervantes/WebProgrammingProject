	<h2>Importance of CSS</h2>
	<p>Anyone who wants to program web pages should have some 
	understanding of CSS. Some reasons paraphrased from 
	<a href="https://bootcamp.ce.ucf.edu/blog/why-everyone-should-learn-html-css/">
	bootcamp</a>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>CSS is a fundamental part of the web</li>
		<li>You (or someone you know) may want to create your own site - be
			an entrepeneur!</li>
		<li>You can create <em>unique</em> websites - strut your stuff!</li>
		<li>You can make more money - are you a full-stack developer?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Another reason: it will challenge how you think about programming. 
	CSS is NOT like other languages! Embrace it and you'll expand your
	flexibility.</p>

	<a href="https://pethelpful.com/cats/10-Reasons-Why-Cats-Are-Awesome">
	Pethelpful</a> provides a list of 10 reasons:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>They are independent</li>
		<li>They can use the bathroom</li>
		<li>They don't need exercise</li>
		<li>They are good with kids</li>
		<li>They keep quiet</li>
		<li>They are clean</li>
		<li>They can be inside their entire lives</li>
